The project currently has TypeScript compilation errors that prevent successful builds and may cause runtime issues.

## Analysis Results
From our comprehensive code review, the following compilation issues were identified:
- Import/export mismatches
- Undefined properties in strict mode
- Type checking warnings

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All TypeScript files compile without errors
- [ ] Build process (\`npm run build\`) completes successfully
- [ ] No type checking warnings in strict mode
- [ ] All tests pass after compilation fixes

## Estimated Effort
1-2 days

## Dependencies
None - this is a blocking issue for other tasks

## Implementation Notes
1. Run \`tsc --noEmit\` to identify all compilation errors
2. Fix import/export statements
3. Address undefined property errors
4. Ensure strict TypeScript compliance
5. Verify all tests still pass

## Definition of Done
- [ ] \`npm run build\` succeeds without errors
- [ ] \`npm test\` passes all tests  
- [ ] Code review completed and approved
- [ ] Changes merged to main branch")

        --body "## Problem Description
The \`src/cli/\` directory is empty, but the package.json references \`dist/cli.js\` as a binary executable. This breaks the CLI functionality for end users.

## Requirements
Based on our analysis, the CLI should support:
- Basic disassembly operations
- Asset extraction commands
- Analysis and reporting features
- Help documentation and usage examples

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create functional CLI implementation in \`src/cli/\`
- [ ] Ensure \`dist/cli.js\` generates properly during build
- [ ] Implement basic CLI commands:
  - [ ] \`snes-disasm disassemble <rom-file>\`
  - [ ] \`snes-disasm extract <rom-file> [options]\`
  - [ ] \`snes-disasm analyze <rom-file>\`
  - [ ] \`snes-disasm --help\`
- [ ] Include comprehensive help documentation
- [ ] Add usage examples and error handling

## Estimated Effort
3-5 days

## Dependencies
- Depends on: Fix TypeScript Compilation Errors (#$ISSUE_1)

## Technical Requirements
- Use yargs or commander.js for argument parsing
- Implement proper error handling and user feedback
- Support common ROM formats and output options
- Include progress indicators for long operations

## Definition of Done
- [ ] CLI functionality works as expected
- [ ] All commands have proper help text
- [ ] Error handling provides useful feedback
- [ ] Code review completed and approved
- [ ] CLI testing completed by QA team
- [ ] Documentation updated")

The project currently has mixed-language tests (Python and TypeScript) in the tests/ directory, causing inconsistency and potential integration issues.

## Current State Analysis
- TypeScript tests in \`tests/\` directory
- Python test files mixed with TypeScript tests
- Audio module has proper co-located tests in \`src/audio/__tests__/\`
- Inconsistent test organization patterns

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Convert Python tests to TypeScript or relocate appropriately
- [ ] Implement co-located test pattern across all modules
- [ ] Follow audio module structure: \`src/[module]/__tests__/\`
- [ ] Ensure test consistency and remove language mixing
- [ ] Update Jest configuration if needed
- [ ] Maintain 100% test pass rate throughout refactoring

## Estimated Effort
2-3 days

## Dependencies
None - can be worked on in parallel with other tasks

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All tests follow consistent co-located pattern
- [ ] No mixed-language testing (or clearly documented exceptions)
- [ ] All tests pass in new structure
- [ ] Jest configuration updated appropriately
- [ ] Code review completed and approved
- [ ] Testing documentation updated")

The \`docs/\` directory is currently mostly empty, lacking essential project documentation for developers and users.

## Required Documentation
Based on our analysis, the following documentation is needed:

### Core Documentation
- [ ] API Reference documentation
- [ ] Getting Started guide
- [ ] Architecture overview
- [ ] Contributing guidelines

### Technical Documentation
- [ ] Build and deployment instructions
- [ ] Testing guidelines
- [ ] Code style and conventions
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] API Reference with complete method documentation
- [ ] Getting Started guide for new developers
- [ ] Architecture overview explaining project structure
- [ ] Contributing guidelines for external contributors
- [ ] All documentation is accurate and up-to-date
- [ ] Documentation follows consistent formatting standards

## Estimated Effort
2-3 days

## Dependencies
- Depends on: TypeScript Compilation Fixes (#$ISSUE_1) for accurate API docs
- Depends on: CLI Implementation (#$ISSUE_2) for complete usage documentation

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All planned documentation files created
- [ ] Documentation is technically accurate
- [ ] New developer can follow Getting Started guide successfully
- [ ] API documentation covers all public interfaces
- [ ] Code review completed for technical accuracy
- [ ] Documentation team review completed")
