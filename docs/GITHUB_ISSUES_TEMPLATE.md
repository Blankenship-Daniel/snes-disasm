# GitHub Issues Templates for SNES Disassembler Implementation

## Overview
These templates can be used to create GitHub Issues for tracking the implementation tasks identified in our code review and analysis.

---

## Issue Template 1: Fix TypeScript Compilation Errors

### Title
`[HIGH PRIORITY] Fix TypeScript Compilation Errors`

### Labels
`bug`, `typescript`, `high-priority`, `compilation`

### Issue Body
```markdown
## Problem Description
The project currently has TypeScript compilation errors that prevent successful builds and may cause runtime issues.

## Analysis Results
From our comprehensive code review, the following compilation issues were identified:
- Import/export mismatches
- Undefined properties in strict mode
- Type checking warnings

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All TypeScript files compile without errors
- [ ] Build process (`npm run build`) completes successfully
- [ ] No type checking warnings in strict mode
- [ ] All tests pass after compilation fixes

## Estimated Effort
1-2 days

## Dependencies
None - this is a blocking issue for other tasks

## Implementation Notes
1. Run `tsc --noEmit` to identify all compilation errors
2. Fix import/export statements
3. Address undefined property errors
4. Ensure strict TypeScript compliance
5. Verify all tests still pass

## Definition of Done
- [ ] `npm run build` succeeds without errors
- [ ] `npm test` passes all tests
- [ ] Code review completed and approved
- [ ] Changes merged to main branch

## Related Issues
- Blocks: CLI Implementation (#TBD)
- Blocks: Documentation Updates (#TBD)
```

## Issue Template 2: Implement CLI Functionality

### Title
`[HIGH PRIORITY] Implement Missing CLI Functionality`

### Labels
`feature`, `cli`, `high-priority`, `enhancement`

### Issue Body
```markdown
## Problem Description
The `src/cli/` directory is empty, but the package.json references `dist/cli.js` as a binary executable. This breaks the CLI functionality for end users.

## Requirements
Based on our analysis, the CLI should support:
- Basic disassembly operations
- Asset extraction commands
- Analysis and reporting features
- Help documentation and usage examples

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create functional CLI implementation in `src/cli/`
- [ ] Ensure `dist/cli.js` generates properly during build
- [ ] Implement basic CLI commands:
  - [ ] `snes-disasm disassemble <rom-file>`
  - [ ] `snes-disasm extract <rom-file> [options]`
  - [ ] `snes-disasm analyze <rom-file>`
  - [ ] `snes-disasm --help`
- [ ] Include comprehensive help documentation
- [ ] Add usage examples and error handling

## Estimated Effort
3-5 days

## Dependencies
- Depends on: Fix TypeScript Compilation Errors (#TBD)

## Technical Requirements
- Use yargs or commander.js for argument parsing
- Implement proper error handling and user feedback
- Support common ROM formats and output options
- Include progress indicators for long operations

## Implementation Plan
1. Set up CLI framework (yargs/commander)
2. Create main CLI entry point (`src/cli/index.ts`)
3. Implement core commands (disassemble, extract, analyze)
4. Add help system and documentation
5. Test CLI functionality end-to-end
6. Update package.json bin configuration

## Definition of Done
- [ ] CLI functionality works as expected
- [ ] All commands have proper help text
- [ ] Error handling provides useful feedback
- [ ] Code review completed and approved
- [ ] CLI testing completed by QA team
- [ ] Documentation updated

## Related Issues
- Depends on: TypeScript Compilation Fixes (#TBD)
- Related to: Documentation Updates (#TBD)
```

## Issue Template 3: Consolidate Testing Strategy

### Title
`[HIGH PRIORITY] Consolidate Mixed Testing Strategy`

### Labels
`testing`, `refactoring`, `high-priority`, `technical-debt`

### Issue Body
```markdown
## Problem Description
The project currently has mixed-language tests (Python and TypeScript) in the tests/ directory, causing inconsistency and potential integration issues.

## Current State Analysis
- TypeScript tests in `tests/` directory
- Python test files mixed with TypeScript tests
- Audio module has proper co-located tests in `src/audio/__tests__/`
- Inconsistent test organization patterns

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Convert Python tests to TypeScript or relocate appropriately
- [ ] Implement co-located test pattern across all modules
- [ ] Follow audio module structure: `src/[module]/__tests__/`
- [ ] Ensure test consistency and remove language mixing
- [ ] Update Jest configuration if needed
- [ ] Maintain 100% test pass rate throughout refactoring

## Estimated Effort
2-3 days

## Dependencies
None - can be worked on in parallel with other tasks

## Implementation Plan
1. Audit all Python test files for functionality
2. Either convert Python tests to TypeScript or document why they're needed
3. Move existing TypeScript tests to co-located pattern
4. Update Jest configuration for new test structure
5. Verify all tests pass in new structure
6. Clean up old test directory

## Test Structure Goal
```
src/
├── core/
│   ├── disassembler.ts
│   └── __tests__/
│       └── disassembler.test.ts
├── audio/
│   ├── BRRDecoder.ts      # Note: Flagged as unused by knip analysis
│   └── __tests__/         # ✅ Already implemented
│       └── BRRDecoder.test.ts
└── rom/
    ├── parser.ts
    └── __tests__/
        └── parser.test.ts
```

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All tests follow consistent co-located pattern
- [ ] No mixed-language testing (or clearly documented exceptions)
- [ ] All tests pass in new structure
- [ ] Jest configuration updated appropriately
- [ ] Code review completed and approved
- [ ] Testing documentation updated

## Related Issues
- Independent of other high-priority tasks
- Related to: Documentation Updates (#TBD)

## Issue Template 4: Create Comprehensive Documentation

### Title
`[MEDIUM PRIORITY] Populate Documentation Directory`

### Labels
`documentation`, `medium-priority`, `enhancement`

### Issue Body

## Creating Issues Command Line

To create these issues quickly using GitHub CLI:

```bash
# Install GitHub CLI if not already installed
# brew install gh (macOS) or follow installation instructions

# Create the issues (replace with actual repository)
gh issue create --title "[HIGH PRIORITY] Fix TypeScript Compilation Errors" --label "bug,typescript,high-priority,compilation" --body-file typescript-issue.md

gh issue create --title "[HIGH PRIORITY] Implement Missing CLI Functionality" --label "feature,cli,high-priority,enhancement" --body-file cli-issue.md

gh issue create --title "[HIGH PRIORITY] Consolidate Mixed Testing Strategy" --label "testing,refactoring,high-priority,technical-debt" --body-file testing-issue.md

gh issue create --title "[MEDIUM PRIORITY] Populate Documentation Directory" --label "documentation,medium-priority,enhancement" --body-file docs-issue.md
```

## Project Board Setup

Consider setting up a GitHub Project board with columns:
- **Backlog**: Newly created issues
- **Ready**: Issues ready for development
- **In Progress**: Currently being worked on
- **Review**: Ready for code review
- **Testing**: In QA testing phase
- **Done**: Completed and merged

This provides visual tracking of implementation progress and helps coordinate team efforts.
