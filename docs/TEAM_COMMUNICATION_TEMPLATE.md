**Hi Team,**

We've completed a comprehensive code review and project structure analysis of the SNES Disassembler project. The analysis revealed both significant strengths and critical areas requiring immediate attention.

## 🎯 **Executive Summary**

**✅ Project Strengths:**
- Strong TypeScript configuration with modern features
- Well-organized audio subsystem (exemplary module structure)
- Robust test suite with comprehensive instruction coverage
- Logical module separation and solid build system

**⚠️ Critical Issues Requiring Action:**
- TypeScript compilation errors blocking builds
- Missing CLI functionality (empty `src/cli/` directory)
- Mixed-language testing strategy causing inconsistency
- Missing documentation and examples
