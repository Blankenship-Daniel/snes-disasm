  - Suggested output formats based on ROM characteristics
  - Memory region detection and recommendations
  - Optimal settings suggestions

#### 3.2 Settings Preview & Confirmation
- **Operation Preview System** (`src/cli/settings-preview.ts`):
  - Comprehensive settings summary before execution
  - Estimated processing time and output size
  - Visual operation breakdown
  - Confirmation dialog with detailed preview

- **Smart Estimations**:
  - Processing time based on ROM size and selected operations
  - Output size estimation for disk space planning
  - Performance recommendations for large ROMs

#### 3.3 Real-Time Progress & Feedback
- **Enhanced Progress Tracking**:
  - Real ROM analysis instead of fake progress bars
  - Meaningful task descriptions
  - Better error reporting with context
  - Success summaries with output details

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Architecture Improvements

#### Modular Design
```
src/cli/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ session-manager.ts     # Session state and persistence
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ help-system.ts         # Contextual help database
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ settings-preview.ts    # Operation preview and confirmation
```

#### Key Classes and Functions
- `SessionManager`: Handles user preferences and recent files
- `getHelpForContext()`: Provides contextual help content
- `generateSettingsPreview()`: Creates operation summaries
- `confirmSettings()`: Interactive confirmation dialogs

### Data Persistence
- Session data stored in `~/.snes-disassembler/session.json`
- Recent files with metadata (name, size, last used, ROM info)
- User preferences (default paths, formats, options)
- Project configurations for complex workflows
