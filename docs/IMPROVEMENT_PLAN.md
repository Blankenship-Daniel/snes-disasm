# SNES Disassembler Improvement Plan

This document outlines the improvements needed for the SNES disassembler based on analysis of multiple ROM files. Each item includes a checkbox for progress tracking.

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENT

**ALWAYS use the snes-mister, snes9x, snes-mcp-server MCP servers when implementing these improvements**

These MCP servers provide authoritative SNES hardware information, emulation data, and reference materials that are essential for accurate implementation. Consult them for:
- Hardware register specifications
- Instruction set validation
- Timing information
- Memory mapping details
- Enhancement chip specifications
- Game-specific patterns and behaviors
